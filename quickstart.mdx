Welcome! This guide will help you get your first response from the llm.kiwi API.

## Get started in three steps

Follow these steps to integrate professional-grade AI into your application.

### Step 1: Create your API Key

Go to the [llm.kiwi Dashboard](https://llm.kiwi/dashboard) and sign in (using Google). Navigate to the **API Keys** section and generate a new key.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your API key is shown only once. Copy it and store it securely in your environment variables.

### Step 2: Choose your SDK

llm.kiwi is fully compatible with the official OpenAI SDKs. This means you can use existing libraries in your favorite language.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Node.js
npm install openai
```
```bash Python
pip install openai
```
```bash PHP
composer require openai-php/client
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 3: Make your first request

Configure the client with our base URL and your key, then run the code to get a response from our `fast` model.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://api.llm.kiwi/v1',
  apiKey: process.env.LLM_KIWI_API_KEY
});

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'fast',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say hello in a professional way!' }]
});

console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```

```python Python
from openai import OpenAI
import os

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.llm.kiwi/v1",
    api_key=os.environ.get("LLM_KIWI_API_KEY")
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="fast",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello in a professional way!"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
</CodeGroup>
