llm.kiwi uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

## HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `200` | Success | Everything worked as expected. |
| `400` | Bad Request | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing parameters. |
| `401` | Unauthorized | No valid API key provided. |
| `403` | Forbidden | You lack permissions for the requested resource (e.g., tier limits). |
| `404` | Not Found | The requested resource doesn't exist. |
| `429` | Rate Limit | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. |
| `500` | Server Error | Something went wrong on our end. |

## Error Object Structure

When an error occurs, the API returns a JSON object with details about the failure.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "The model 'invalid-model' does not exist.",
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "model_not_found"
  }
}
```

## Common Error Scenarios

### Rate Limiting (`429`)
If you exceed your tier's limits, you will receive a 429 error. We recommend implementing exponential backoff to handle these gracefully.

### Token Limits (`400`)
If your `messages` array combined with `max_tokens` exceeds the model's context window, the request will fail.

### Invalid Key (`401`)
Ensure your `Authorization` header is formatted correctly as `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.
