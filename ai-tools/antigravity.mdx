Antigravity is Google's advanced platform for agentic coding. By connecting llm.kiwi, you can power your Antigravity agents with professional-grade AI models.

## Setup Instructions

llm.kiwi is fully compatible with Antigravity's model provider interface.

### 1. Obtain Your API Key
Ensure you have an active API key from your [llm.kiwi dashboard](https://llm.kiwi/dashboard/keys).

### 2. Configure Antigravity
In your Antigravity configuration environment, add llm.kiwi as a custom provider.

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "llm-kiwi": {
      "baseUrl": "https://api.llm.kiwi/v1",
      "apiKey": "YOUR_LLM_KIWI_KEY",
      "models": ["pro", "fast", "default"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Supported Workflows

Use llm.kiwi's `pro` model for high-precision tasks within Antigravity:

*   **Agentic Planning**: Complex task breakdown using the `pro` model.
*   **Code Generation**: Rapid scaffolding and logic implementation.
*   **Verification**: Automated testing and code review.

> [!NOTE]
> Antigravity's agentic tools work best with the `pro` model due to its advanced reasoning capabilities.
