Configure Windsurf's Cascade AI assistant to help you write and maintain documentation. This guide shows how to set up Windsurf specifically for your Mintlify documentation workflow.

## llm.kiwi Integration

Windsurf is an agentic IDE by Codeium that emphasizes flow. You can connect it to llm.kiwi to leverage your own model tier and advanced capabilities.

### 1. Custom Model Provider
1. Open Windsurf Settings.
2. Search for "Provider" or "LLM".
3. Select **Custom OpenAI** or **OpenAI**.
4. Enter your Base URL: `https://api.llm.kiwi/v1`
5. Enter your llm.kiwi API Key.

### 2. MCP Integration
Windsurf has excellent support for MCP, allowing the IDE agent to call llm.kiwi tools directly.

To add llm.kiwi as an MCP server:
1. Open the MCP configuration in Windsurf.
2. Add the following server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "llm-kiwi": {
      "url": "https://api.llm.kiwi/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Supported Workflows
*   **Cascade Coding**: Use the `pro` model to power Windsurf's Cascade for deep codebase reasoning.
*   **Agentic Tools**: Trigger image generation or transcription by simply asking Cascade.
