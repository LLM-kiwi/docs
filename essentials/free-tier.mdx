We believe in making powerful AI accessible to everyone. Our free tier allows developers to experiment and build prototypes without any upfront cost.

## What's Included

The free tier provides access to our core models with generous initial limits.

*   **Models**: Access to `pro`, `fast`, and `default` models.
*   **API Keys**: Generate up to 2 active API keys.
*   **Usage**: Up to 40,000 Tokens Per Minute.

## Usage Policies

To maintain the quality of the free tier, the following policies apply:

*   **No Credit Card Required**: Sign up and start building immediately.
*   **Fair Use**: Automated "scraping" or heavy production traffic should be moved to a paid tier.
*   **Attribution**: If you use our free tier in a public project, we appreciate an "AI powered by llm.kiwi" link, though it's not required.

## Upgrading

Moving to a paid tier is seamless. Your API keys and data remain the same, and your limits are instantly increased upon upgrade.
