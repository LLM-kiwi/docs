## API Key Management

### Creating Keys

Generate new API keys with custom configurations:

1. Navigate to **API Keys** in your dashboard
2. Click **Create New Key**
3. Configure key settings:
   - **Name**: Descriptive label (e.g., "Production Backend")
   - **Scope**: Select allowed endpoints
   - **Expiration**: Optional auto-expiration date

<Warning>
  API keys are shown **only once** at creation. Store them securely immediately.
</Warning>

### Key Scopes

Restrict what each key can access:

| Scope | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `chat:read` | Read-only access to models list |
| `chat:write` | Create chat completions |
| `images:write` | Generate images |
| `audio:write` | Transcribe audio |
| `*` | Full access (default) |

### Rotating Keys

Regularly rotate keys for security:

1. Create a new key with the same configuration
2. Update your applications with the new key
3. Delete the old key once migration is complete

<Tip>
  Use environment variables to store keys, making rotation easier.
</Tip>
