---

All requests to the llm.kiwi API must be authenticated using an API key. This ensures secure access and provides reliable usage tracking for your account.

## API Keys

Your API keys are the primary way to authenticate with llm.kiwi. You can manage your keys in the [Developer Dashboard](https://llm.kiwi/dashboard/keys).

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys confidential. Do not share them in public repositories, client-side code, or insecure environments.
</Warning>

### Key Format

llm.kiwi API keys follow a standard format: `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every HTTP request.

### Authorization Header

The API uses the standard Bearer token authentication scheme.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Examples

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://api.llm.kiwi/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "default",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```


```python Python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.llm.kiwi/v1",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="default",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```


```javascript Node.js
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://api.llm.kiwi/v1',
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
});

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'default',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }]
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Security Best Practices

To keep your account and data secure, follow these industry-standard security practices:

- **Environment Variables**: Never hardcode API keys. Use `.env` files or secret management systems.
- **Server-Side Only**: Access the API from your backend. Client-side requests expose your key to users.
- **Key Rotation**: Delete and regenerate keys periodically to minimize the impact of potential leaks.
- **Scoped Access**: Use different keys for development, staging, and production environments.

## Authentication Errors

If there is an issue with your credentials, the API will return a `401 Unauthorized` response.
