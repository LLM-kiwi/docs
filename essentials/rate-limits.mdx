description: "Understanding API rate limits and quotas across all tiers"
---

To ensure platform stability and fair access for all users, llm.kiwi implements rate limits across all API endpoints.

## Rate Limits by Tier

<Note>
  All limits reset daily at **Midnight UTC**.
</Note>

| Tier | Daily Requests | Requests/Min (RPM) | Max Tokens |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anonymous** | 100 (shared) | 10 | 2,048 |
| **Free** (registered) | 500 | 20 | 4,096 |
| **Pro** | Unlimited* | 100 | 32,768 |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Custom |

*Pro tier has soft limits for abuse prevention. Contact support if you need higher throughput.

## Rate Limit Headers

Each API response includes headers to help you track your usage:

| Header | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed per minute |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the limit resets |

## Handling Rate Limits

When a rate limit is reached, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

### Retry Strategy

Implement exponential backoff with jitter for optimal retry handling:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import time
import random

def make_request_with_retry(func, max_retries=5):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return func()
        except RateLimitError:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            wait_time = (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
            time.sleep(wait_time)
```

```javascript JavaScript
async function makeRequestWithRetry(fn, maxRetries = 5) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.status !== 429 || attempt === maxRetries - 1) throw error;
      const waitTime = Math.pow(2, attempt) + Math.random();
      await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, waitTime * 1000));
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Best Practices

1. **Exponential Backoff**: Wait progressively longer between retries (2s, 4s, 8s, etc.)
2. **Request Batching**: Combine multiple operations when possible
3. **Token Monitoring**: Check response headers to anticipate limits
4. **Caching**: Cache responses for repeated identical queries
