To ensure stability and fair access for all users, llm.kiwi implements rate limits across all API endpoints.

## Tiered Limits

Limits are applied based on your current account tier.

| Tier | Tokens Per Minute (TPM) | Requests Per Minute (RPM) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Free** | 40,000 | 3 |
| **Developer** | 200,000 | 50 |
| **Scale** | 1,000,000 | 500 |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom |

## Handling Rate Limits

When a rate limit is reached, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

### Best Practices

1.  **Exponential Backoff**: If you receive a 429, wait for a short period before retrying. Increase the wait time exponentially with each subsequent failure.
2.  **Request Optimization**: Batch tasks when possible and avoid redundant calls.
3.  **Token Management**: Monitor your token usage in the response headers to anticipate limits.

## Increasing Your Limits

If your application requires higher throughput, you can upgrade your plan in the [Billing Dashboard](https://llm.kiwi/dashboard/billing) or contact our support team for enterprise-grade custom limits.
