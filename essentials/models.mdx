llm.kiwi offers a curated selection of models optimized for speed, intelligence, and cost-efficiency. By abstracting complex model names, we provide a stable interface that always leverages the best available technology.

## Model Tiers

We offer three primary tiers to balance performance and latency.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Pro" icon="stars">
    The most capable model for complex reasoning and creative tasks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fast" icon="bolt">
    Highly optimized for latency and quick interactions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Default" icon="gears">
    The standard balance of speed and capability for general use.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Model Details

| Slug | Best For | Typical Latency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pro` | Advanced coding, complex reasoning, long-form writing | Moderate |
| `fast` | Real-time chat, simple extraction, basic classification | Ultra-low |
| `default` | General purpose tasks, summarization, conversational AI | Low |

## Model Updates

We continuously evaluate and update the underlying architecture of our models. Using the static slugs (`pro`, `fast`, `default`) ensures that your integration remains stable while automatically benefiting from the latest AI advancements.

> [!TIP]
> Use the `pro` model for tasks requiring high precision, and switch to `fast` for UI-critical elements where speed is paramount.
